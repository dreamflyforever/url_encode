## URL encode
URL encoding, also known as percent-encoding, is a mechanism for encoding 
information in a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) under certain 
circumstances. Although it is known as URL encoding it is, in fact, 
used more generally within the main Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) set, 
which includes both Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and Uniform Resource 
Name (URN). As such it is also used in the preparation of data of the 
"application/x-www-form-urlencoded" media type, as is often used in the 
submission of HTML form data in HTTP requests.
